<style="font-size: 250%;"></style>* Why would you consider a Scripting Language as JavaScript as your Backend Platform.
</pre>
The line between scripting language and 'normal' compiled programming language are getting more and more blurred, since hardware are getting better and better, the compilers gets faster and faster.
Javascipt is being interpreted by the V8 engine. That means that it runs inside of another program. Often a scripting language is faster to learn and use. You can often do more with less code.

Another reason to use javascript is that in frontend, we almost always use javascript already. By having the same language in frontend and backend, we can reuse and optimize the developer resources in a company.
A backend programmer can help with the frontend if needed and vice versa.

* Explain Pros & Cons in using Node.js + Express to implement your Backend compared to a strategy using for example Java/JAX-RS/Tomcat




* Node.js uses a Single Threaded Non-blocking strategy to handle asynchronous task. Explain strategies to implement a Node.js based server architecture that still could take advantage of a multi-core Server.



* Explain, using relevant examples, concepts related to the testing a REST-API using Node/JavaScript + relevant packages



* Explain, using relevant examples, the Express concept; middleware.



* Explain, using relevant examples, how to implement sessions, and the legal implications of doing this.



* Compare the express strategy toward (server side) templating with the one you used with Java on second semester.



* Explain, using a relevant examples, your strategy for implementing a REST-API with Node/Express and show how you can "test" all the four CRUD operations programmatically using for example the Request package.



* Explain, using relevant examples, about testing JavaScript code, relevant packages (Mocha etc.) and how to test asynchronous code.



* Explain, using relevant examples, different ways to mock out databases, HTTP-request etc.
